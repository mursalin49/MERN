    A web developer is a tech professional who designs, builds, and maintains websites and web applications. They can specialize in one part of a website (as a front-end or back-end developer) or be responsible for both (as a full-stack developer.) As a web developer, it's your job to ensure a website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and functions well. You can learn more about the programming languages, skills, and salaries of web developers in the following article.
